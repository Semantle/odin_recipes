    <h2>The Perfect Drink for a Summer's Day</h2>
    <p>My father taught me how to make this recipe when I was a little girl. It is very easy to make. This recipe contains <strong>Raw Eggs</strong>. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make It Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make a banana smoothie:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine banana, milk, vanilla, egg and sugar. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour into a tall glass and top with a pinch of cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Voila. That's it! How simple was that?!</li>
    </ol>
